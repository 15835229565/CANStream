CANStream is a .NET application intended to be used for CAN (Controller Area Network) bus communication development, testing and validation.

CANStream allows to extensively test any system using CAN communication by sending and receiving CAN frames. Thanks to its powerful built-in mathematical expression evaluator, CANStream can also behave as a real control system feeding back the test device or commanding a third party device with context sensible data.

Extended data logging and data analysis features of CANStream provide a comprehensive solution for testing and results analysis.

CANStream extensively uses the PEAK PCAN-Basic API developed by PEAK System for the PCAN-USB adapter
For more information about PEAK System: http://www.peak-system.com

You will therefore need to have PEAK PCAN-USB adapter and at least one free USB port available to make a complete use of CANStream.

CANStream can manage up to eight PEAK PCAN-USB adapters at the same time, thus you will need eight USB ports available.

As any .NET application, CANStream needs a Microsoft .NET framework to operate. You might need to install or upgrade your .NET framework.

If so, please visit http://www.microsoft.com/net to download the latest version of the Microsoft .NET framework.
